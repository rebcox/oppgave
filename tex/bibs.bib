abstract = "Publisher Summary The purpose of this chapter is to explain the brain imaging technology and provide insights into how experiments are designed and interpreted. Whole brain imaging technology can essentially be divided into two categories: structural and functional. Structural techniques produce images of the anatomical architecture of the brain, whereas functional techniques produce images of the physiological processes that underscore neural activity. This discussion surveys both classification of techniques and describes how they can be used in modern neuroscience research. Further, it focuses on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \{MRI\} takes advantage of the magnetic properties of neural tissue to produce an image. Most often, \{MRI\} utilizes the magnetic properties of hydrogen protons, as they are highly abundant in the fluids and organic compounds of the brain and body. The main function of an \{MRI\} scanner is to artificially excite these hydrogen protons and then measure their relaxation properties over time. \{FMRI\} technology takes advantage of the signal intensity of another substance within the brain: hemoglobin, the protein in the blood that carries oxygen to cells. On a \{T2\} image, oxyhemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying form of hemoglobin) has a relatively stronger magnetic resonance signal than deoxyhemoglobin. Thus, fMRI allows an investigator the opportunity to examine changes in the oxygenation-state of hemoglobin over time. Additionally, the chapter surveys the essential components of a functional imaging experiment: forming hypotheses, choosing appropriate task paradigms, performing experiments, acquiring and analyzing data, and producing figures for publication.

abstract = "Abstract Individual differences in the temporal dynamics of the haemodynamic response can reflect cortical excitation and can reveal underlying cortical physiology. Here, we show differences in the shape of the haemodynamic response that are dependent on stimulus parameters. Two sets of visual stimuli were used varying in parameters that are known to manipulate the haemodynamic response in the visual cortex. We measured the oxyhaemoglobin response using near infrared spectroscopy. The first set of stimuli comprised chromatic square-wave gratings that varied with respect to the separation in the \{CIE\} \{UCS\} chromaticities of the alternating bars. The gratings with large separations in chromaticity evoked an oxyhaemoglobin response with greater amplitude, consistent with greater activation of the visual cortex. The second set of stimuli comprised horizontal achromatic gratings that (1) were static, (2) drifted at a constant velocity towards fixation, or (3) reversed direction every half spatial cycle to create a vertical vibrating motion. Although the three types of grating had a similar effect on the amplitude of the oxyhaemoglobin response, the moving gratings (2 and 3) evoked a steeper decrease in oxyhaemoglobin concentration after stimulus-offset. The steeper slope appears to reflect the post-stimulus undershoot and the slope may provide a correlate of cortical excitability when the amplitude of the haemodynamic response has saturated. "
